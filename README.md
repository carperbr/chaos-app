# Music Theory / Chaos Theory app
The start of an application for making music by combining music theory and chaos theory.

The utils folder contains a weird numerical integrator I coded naively after staring at the Butcher tableau for the Dormand-Prince 5/4 method and reading the wikipedia page until it made sense lol. The numerical integrator is going to play a crucial role in the app, though right now it's not used anywhere.
